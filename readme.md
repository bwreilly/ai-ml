### Kalman Filter

A [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) attempts to determine state from noisy input data, typically paired with positional shifting. In this implementation, the predict step offers a method of convolution (state becomes less certain) typical of movement and measurement (in which the state is likely to become more certain). Most common [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Applications) are in reference, navigation, and guidance.  

##  Credit

Some has been derived from work done in the [Stanford Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai-class.com/) class and the [Udacity course CS373: Programming a Robot Car](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs373/), modified for clarity and reusability. I am deeply indebted to the efforts of those involved in the making of those classes (Sebastian Thrun, Peter Norvig, and the staffs at ai-class.com and udacity.com)
